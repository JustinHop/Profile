Battery widget

This widget is a battery monitor. It gets its information from acpi, to be as
uniquely usable as possible. If you click on the widget, additional information
is displayed. Currently, only the first battery is monitored on the widget box,
but information about all other attached batteries is still visible if you click
the widget.

To use it, include it into your rc.lua by inserting this line:
    require("obvious.battery")
into the top of your rc.lua. Then add the widget to your wibox. It's called
    obvious.battery()
