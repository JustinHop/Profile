Clock: alarms file should be created if doesn't exist
================================================================================

Clock: needs more beautiful theming?
================================================================================

Clock: raises error on menu
================================================================================
W: awesome: luaA_dofunction:317: error running function: /usr/local/share/awesome/lib/awful/menu.lua:48: bad argument #3 to '?' (string expected, got nil)

This causes the menu to stick open.

General: I think we should make a specification for configuring widgets
================================================================================
Like, wouldn't it be cool if every widget had a similar interface used for
configuring it? Something along the lines of:

clock.settings.format.base = "%d %Y %m"
clock.settings.format.expanded = "%d %Y %m %s"
battery.settings.mainbattery = 1
simplempd.settings.host = "localhost"
