Notes:

I spent a lot of time breaking my terminals down to 8 colors and assigning them to the solarized pallet and to use the terminal fonts included

Switch vim profiles with the VIM_PROFILES var, which I should update to be : delimited, not space.

Lots of host and user specific stuffs

edit ~/hostinfo for a note in your prompt about what system you are on
