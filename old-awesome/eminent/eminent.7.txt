NAME
----
eminent - a lua library for dynamic tagging in awesome

SYNOPSIS
--------
None

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*eminent* is a lua library for use with the awesome window manager, which will enable you to use dynamic tagging.
Dynamic tagging in this instance means that the amount of tags you have is not pre-defined, you can give specific tags names, but simply going to the next tag when you're on the last tag will provide you with a brand new one, allowing you to adapt to various usage situations without changing your configuration file to give you more or less tags.

USAGE
-----
To use eminent, you will need to edit portions of your rc.lua configuration file.

Firstly, you will need to add **require(\'eminent')** to the top, this includes the eminent library in your configuration file, and starts up the dynamic tagging.

Secondly, you will need to remove all code that creates tags, tags are now created by eminent, so manually creating them is redundant.

Thirdly, if you use a taglist, you will have to format the label function so that it will only display tags with clients on them, if you use the default taglist function in awful, this will do the trick:
--------------------
function mytaglist.label(t) 
if not eminent.isoccupied(t.screen, t) and not t.selected then return end
return awful.widget.taglist.label.all(t, bg_focus, fg_focus) end
--------------------

Lastly, you will have to change your hotkeys or mouse bindings to use eminent.tag.next and eminent.tag.prev for switching to the previous or next tag, and eminent.tag.getn for getting a tag by number.

An example config using eminent is available at **http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/index.php/Eminent**.
