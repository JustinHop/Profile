ZSH-GIT based on http://www.wunjo.org/zsh-git

The git integration bits are mostly separated into a module called 'zgitinit',
where as the prompt is a standard zsh prompt theme.

Obtain zsh-git:
  % git clone git://github.com/olemarkus/zsh-git.git zsh-git

To use this, you need to get the files in functions somewhere that zsh can find
them, here's two way so to do that:

System wide:
  # cp zsh-git/functions/* /usr/share/zsh/site-functions

or just for your user:
  % mkdir -p ~/.zsh/functions
  % cp /zsh-git/functions/* ~/.zsh/functions
  % cat "fpath=($fpath $HOME/.zsh/func)
  typeset -U fpath" >> ~/.zshenv

If you want, you can also just clone the repos directly into .zsh/functions or /usr/share/zsh/site-functions

Example minimal zshrc is in zshrc.
