Clock Widget

To use this widget, first add a
    require("widgets.clock")
to your rc.lua after the line which initialises beautiful. That line looks like this:
    beautiful.init(theme_path)
then add widgets.clock() to your wiboxes widget list.

This widget has an alarmfile, which contains stuff to remember like this:
    14:30 get pizza from oven
these alarms (one per line) are shown with naughty. If one alarm is shown,
the clock will change its colors to indicate that. If you then click on
it, all alarms since the last click are shown.
The alarm file is contained in ${XDG_CONFIG_DIR}/awesome/alarms. In most cases this
would be ~/.config/awesome/alarms.

To choose your editor, execute widgets.clock.set_editor("foo").
