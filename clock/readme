Clock Widget

To use this widget, first add a
    require("obvious.clock")
to the beginning of your rc.lua, then add obvious.clock() to your wiboxes widget list.

This widget has an alarmfile, which contains stuff to remember like this:
    14:30
    get pizza from oven
these alarms (each consisting of two lines) are shown with naughty. The first line of each entry
is a Lua regular expression to match against the time in strftime format %a-%d-%m-%Y:%H:%M, which looks like this:
    Tue-26-05-2009:22:01
The second line contains the message to show. You can use \n inside the message body if you want a newline.

If one alarm is shown, the clock will change its colors to indicate that. If you then click on
it, all alarms since the last click are shown.

The alarm file is contained in ${XDG_CONFIG_DIR}/awesome/alarms. In most cases this
would be ~/.config/awesome/alarms.

To choose your editor, execute obvious.clock.set_editor("foo").
